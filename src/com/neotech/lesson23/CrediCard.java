    â–ª Create a class CreditCard and define two variables, balance and interest.
    â–ª Create an instance method that will calculate the interest based on the given balance.
    â–ª Create 2 subclasses: Visa and AX. In AX class override the method calculate interest.
    â–ª Call the method by creating an object of each of the three classes.
